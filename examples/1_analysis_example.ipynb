    "## Introduction to temperature scoring and portfolio coverage methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Three methods are currently supported by the [SBTi](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/financial-institutions) for setting targets on scope 3 portfolio emissions: the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA), the SBT Portfolio Coverage, and the CDP-WWF Temperature Scoring Method. The latter two methods, Portfolio Coverage and Temperature Scoring, require assessing targets disclosed by the companies. These methods can also be used by companies outside of the finance sector, e.g. for assessing their own value chains and in particular the supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tool allows users to use the portfolio coverage and/or [the CDP-WWF Temperature Scoring Methodology](https://wwfint.awsassets.panda.org/downloads/cdp-wwf-temperature-scoring-methodology---september-2024.pdf) to set targets for their value chains or financial portfolios which may include for instance suppliers, clients, corporate debt, equity, bonds, private equity and and other financial instruments and activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *portfolio coverage method* asseses how much of the portfolio or value chain that has set emissions reduction targets *validated by the SBTi*. This is similar to the SBTi supplier engagement method that can be used by non-financial companies to set SBTi targets for parts of their scope 3 emissions. The portfolio coverage method produces a percentage showing how much of a portfolio or value chaing that has set an SBTi-validated target.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the *temperature scoring method*, the user can assess the current temperature score of their portfolio or value chain based on the public GHG emissions reduction targets set by their portfolio or value chain constutuents. These targets include *all public targets*, validated by the SBTi or otherwise valid public emissions reduction targets that meet the method criteria. The resulting temperature score can then then be used by financial institutions and non-financial companies to set their own scope 3 targets to align their base year portfolio temperature score to a long-term temperature goal, e.g. 1.5°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDP-WWF Temperature Scoring Methodology is an open source framework to enable the translation of corporate GHG emission reduction targets into temperature scores at a target, company, and a portfolio level. The method provides a protocol to enable the aggregation of target level scores to generate a temperature score for a company based on the ambition of its targets.\n",
    "Finally, the method defines a series of weighting options that can enable financial institutions and others to produce portfolio level temperature ratings."

    "The SBTi originally developed this tool to function as a calculator for the portfolio coverage and temperature scoring methods. WWF have updated the tool to integrate with the latest science, such as building regression models on AR6, using a compounded emissions reduction instead of linnear, introducing a temperaturee floor at 1.5°C, as well as adding a number of improvements to the tool.\n",
